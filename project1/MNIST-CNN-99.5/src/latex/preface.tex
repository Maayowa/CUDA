The idea for \f{WEBGUI} came from Randolph E. Bank and Michael Holst of the University
of California at San Diego. They each have existing scientific software (PLTMG and FETK
respectively) and they wanted a graphical user interface (GUI) that was platform independent and
could control their software either locally or remotely. They suggested building a GUI that
displayed in a web browser. It has been my great pleasure to create this \f{WEBGUI}. 
 
This version of \f{WEBGUI} was supported by the National Science Foundation
through grant DMS-1345013.
